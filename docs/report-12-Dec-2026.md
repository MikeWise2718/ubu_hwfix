# Status Luxray sleeping issues 
- 12 Jan 2026 10:50
- Logged in to luxray a few times remotely from Spearow using Nomachine, sometimes after hours long pauses
- Shutdown Spearow for the night
- Luxray seeming ran all night - Luxray appears to be running
- Luxray screen did not blank - I could see the Ubuntu desktop and I assume it did not sleep
- Luxray mouse worked, but the keyboard was unresponsive so I couldn't do anything. I didn't try plugging it in and out which might have fixed it
- In the morming - essentially now -  logging into Luxray using Nomachine from Spearrow worked - but not instantaniously - it took about 10 seconds and had a white screen for awhile
